```This repository contains both the simulation files and the final project report.```

The aim of this work was to design and simulate a simple and cheap machine-learning classifier-based waste retrieval robot to help collect and retrieve plastic bottles in its immediate environment.

The robot and test environment were designed with the Webots simulation software. These were then used to train a Haars-Cascade classifier that was able to detect the test bottles. The classifier training was done using Google Collab and the robot control was developed and implemented using the Python programming language. 

The classifier was trained for 14 levels and detected 203 bottles (189 true positive and 14 false positives) bringing the efficiency of our final Haars Cascade classifier to 93.10%.
